# dcrawler
WIP dungeon crawler started in 2022, confirmed to run on Linux. Probably runs on anything that has ncurses (not confirmed). Personal coding project just to review C programming. Currently a dungeon level is generated with enemies and water, the player can move around and dig and build, but the enemies lack pathfinding (i.e., they are place-holder dummies). Hopefully this will be added at some point.
