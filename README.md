# dcrawler
WIP dungeon crawler started in 2022, confirmed to run on Linux. Probably runs on anything that has ncurses (not confirmed). Personal coding project just to review C programming. Currently a dungeon level is generated with enemies and water, the player can move around and dig, build, and engage in ranged and melee combat. Enemies currently lack pathfinding and are place-holder dummies.

controls:
*arrow keys for movement
*"d" for digging, arrow keys to control direction
*"b" for building walls, arrow keys to control direction wall is placed
*"f" for firing crossbow, arrow keys to control direction crossbow bolt is fired in
